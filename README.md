# .NET Core Date and Time Application

This is a simple .NET Core application that demonstrates how to work with time zones and daylight saving time using the [NodaTime](https://nodatime.org/) library. The application retrieves the current time and converts it to the London time zone, checking whether it is daylight saving time.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [libfaketime](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime) (used within Docker to simulate different date and time scenarios)

## Application Overview

- **Main Program:** The main program retrieves the current date and time, converts it to the London time zone, and checks if daylight saving time is active.
- **Docker Integration:** The application is containerized using Docker. `libfaketime` is used to simulate different dates and times to test the application's behavior.

## How to Build and Run

### Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for this application, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t dotnetcore31-date-app .
```

### Running the Application

You can run the application using Docker with different simulated times:

#### Example 1: Simulating a specific date and time
```bash
docker run -e FAKE_TIME='2024-11-11 21:00:00' dotnetcore31-date-app 
```

#### Example 2: Simulating a date and time during Daylight Saving Time transition

- Just before the Daylight Saving Time ends:
```bash
docker run -e FAKE_TIME='2024-10-27 00:59:00' dotnetcore31-date-app 
```

- Just after the Daylight Saving Time ends:
```bash
docker run -e FAKE_TIME='2024-10-27 01:00:00' dotnetcore31-date-app 
```

## Project Structure

- **Program.cs:** Contains the main logic for retrieving and converting the date and time.
- **Dockerfile:** Instructions to build and run the application inside a Docker container.
- **.csproj file:** Defines the project and manages dependencies.

## Dependencies

- **NodaTime (v3.1.11):** A date and time library for .NET to handle time zones and more complex date/time scenarios.

## Additional Information

- **libfaketime:** A tool used to simulate different dates and times when running the application within a Docker container. This is useful for testing how the application behaves during different periods, such as Daylight Saving Time transitions.
